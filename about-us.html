        <h2>Our mission</h2>
        <p>Welcome to SafeSpace, a mental health support website made from the heart.
This platform was created by someone who has personally faced anxiety, emotional distress, and seen loved ones go through depression.
Our goal is to make sure no one feels alone.

Whether you're struggling silently, need a comforting hug, or just want someone to listen — we are here.
We offer virtual hugs based on your favorite animals, a space to share your story, and soothing features to help you calm down.

You're not alone — your story matters, and your healing starts here</p>
        <h2>contact us</h2>
        <p>if you have any further questions or need further support,feel free to contact us at: <a href="mailto:support@mentalhealth.com">support@mentalhealth.com</a></p>
